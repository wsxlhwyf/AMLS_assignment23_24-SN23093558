# The methodology used in this programme
Both task A and task B use Pytorch to build a Convolutional Neural Netwokr (CNN) to solve the problem.
'main.py' file is used to select whether to choose to run Task A or Task B. 
The hole program can run 3 times. For example, 1 for running Task A, 1 for running Task B, and 1 for a mistake.


# The dataset for both tasks
The datasets for both tasks are downloaded from the website "MedMNIST" to 2 ".npz" file.
Both tasks using "numpy" to load the dataset from the ".npz" file in the "Datasets" file

# The environment of both tasks
The environment of running this programme needs to have the Pytorch and the method of downloading the Pytorch is in the website: https://pytorch.org/
Moreover, to run this program, several libraries need to be import: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.metrics and torch

# Task A
The code for Task A is written in the "A.py" in the "A" file, it can be read by running the "main.py"
The time for running Task A is around 3 minutes and 4 output graphs are shown at last (Training Accuracy, Validation Accuracy, Predict Test Accuracy, and Overall Accuracy)

# Task B
The code for Task B is written in the "B.py" in the "B" file, it can be read by running the "main.py"
The time for running Task B is around 20 minutes and 4 output graphs are shown at last (Training Accuracy, Validation Accuracy, Predict Test Accuracy, and Overall Accuracy)
